The goal of the Open Tree of Life project is to make phylogenetic knowledge more accessible.
This site will allow you to explore previously published tree estimates and synthetic estimates of
phylogenies that are created from many datasets.
You can help make the system more comprehensive by uploading trees or linking trees in the system
to the data on which they are based.
