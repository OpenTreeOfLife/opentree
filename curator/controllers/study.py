## Manages and manipulates studies in the Open Tree curation tool
## - index()    lists all studies in the system? or just mine?
## - create()   makes a new study (incl. one-time imports, etc)
## - edit()     manages an existing study
## - delete() 
## - validate() AJAX checks study against a remote validation service?
## - load()     AJAX call to load from remote store
## - store()    AJAX call to save to remote store
