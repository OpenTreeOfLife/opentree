opentree
========

Umbrella repo for opentree web site and services. Includes code for constructing the synthetic taxonomy.

Installation
============
Instructions coming soon. In the meantime, see the phylografter instructions for
more details about using web2py.

The included **requirements.txt** file lists known-good versions of all the required
python modules for opentree, plus a few convenience modules. To [install these modules 
using pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#requirements-files), 

<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

The contents of the webapp subdirectory are a web2py application.  Make a symbolic 
link called "opentree" in a web2py/applications directory to the webapp directory.
You should be able to launch web2py and see the app running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/opentree/

There is now a second web2py app for the curation tool, which will also need a
symlink. This will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/curator/

Briefly:

1. Download and unpack the source code version of web2py from 
http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/download MTH used version 2.4.2 of web2py

NOTE: This version of web2py includes basic support for OAuth 2.0, but it needs a minor patch to support for login via the GitHub API v3.
(This is used for the curation UI, which uses GitHub for its datastore and attribution.) Replace this web2py file with a modified version in the same folder as this README:
<pre>
{web2py-2.4.4}/gluon/contrib/login_methods/oauth20_account.py
</pre>

2. Create the sym links for the main web app and the study curation tool.

<pre>
cd web2py/applications
ln -s /full/path/to/opentree/webapp opentree
ln -s /full/path/to/opentree/curator curator
</pre>

3. Customize web2py's site-wide routing behavior using "SITE.routes.py"

<pre>
# return to main web2py directory
cd ..  
cp /full/path/to/opentree/SITE.routes.py routes.py
</pre>

This routing file works in tandem with the opentree app router and lets us have
proper URLs with hyphens instead of underscores.

4. Launch web2py

<pre>
cd /full/path/to/web2py
python web2py.py --nogui -a '&lt;recycle&gt;'
</pre>

Where the -a flag is allowing you to reuse the previous admin password that you used
with this instance of web2py.

webapp/controllers
: python code executed by web2py when a URL is successfully mapped to a controller.

: code that describes the database structure used by the web app

webapp/views
: templates for the page content that is rendered in response to a query. The view is typically specific to a few controllers in the web app

webapp/static
